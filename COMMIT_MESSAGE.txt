feat: implement lobby system with player customization (v2.2 - code complete)

# Core Changes
- Add complete lobby system with 2-player setup panels
- Implement name/color customization with network sync
- Add ready-up system with 3-second countdown
- Fix WaveTransitionUI detection logic (critical bug)
- Fix HighscoreManager DontDestroyOnLoad warning
- Rename SceneManager.cs to MenuManager.cs (namespace fix)
- Update scene flow: Menu → Lobby → Game → Restart → Lobby

# New Scripts (Production-Ready)
- LobbyManager.cs: Server-authority lobby controller with FishNet
- PlayerSetupUI.cs: Individual player panel (name, 6 colors, ready button)
- LobbyUI.cs: Main lobby orchestrator with status/countdown display
- MenuManager.cs: Renamed from SceneManager.cs to avoid namespace collision

# Critical Fixes
- WaveTransitionUI.cs: Complete rewrite with edge-detection for wave transitions
  (Old logic could never detect wave completion - countdown never appeared)
- HighscoreManager.cs: Add transform.SetParent(null) before DontDestroyOnLoad
- GameStateManager.cs: Update restart flow to load Lobby scene
- HUDManager.cs: Add diagnostic logging for restart button

# Scene Changes
- Add Lobby.unity (partial - 25% complete, Unity setup in progress)
- Delete SampleScene.unity (unused)
- Update EditorBuildSettings.asset with Lobby scene

# Documentation
+ Add Documentation/LOBBY_SYSTEM_SETUP.md (complete Unity setup guide)
+ Add Documentation/SESSION_PROGRESS_v2.2.md (migration notes)

# Known Limitations
- Lobby scene Unity setup incomplete (Player2_Panel, Status/Countdown panels missing)
- Inspector references not yet assigned
- System non-functional until Unity scene completed (estimated 2-3h work)

# Technical Details
- FishNet NetworkBehaviour with SyncDictionary<int, PlayerLobbyData>
- Server RPCs for player registration, name/color sync, ready toggle
- Event-driven UI updates (OnLobbyStateChanged, OnCountdownTick)
- Character limit (8 chars) enforced via code, not Inspector
- Color presets: Magenta (#AA00C8), Cyan, Yellow, Green, Red, Blue (#0080FF)
